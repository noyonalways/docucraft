YAML is one of the most popular data [`serialization languages`](https://devopedia.org/data-serialization), and it is used mostly for writing configuration files. The YAML recursive acronym stands for **YAML Ain’t Markup Language**. This language is designed with flexibility and accessibility in mind, so it’s human-readable and simple to understand. YAML works with all modern programming languages and is widely used in data persistence, internet messaging, cross-language data sharing, and many other places. YAML files either have the extension .yaml or .yml.

All of these factors contribute to YAML’s popularity as a configuration language in the DevOps domain, where it is widely used with well-known tools such as Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform.
